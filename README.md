# SWAPI
## The Star Wars API

## NO LONGER MAINTAINED!

If you rely on this project for your own tools - then please fork and spin up your own instance. It's a pretty simple project, and the Makefile will take you a long way.

If you are looking for an API to play with to learn about APIs, then I recommend [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co).
